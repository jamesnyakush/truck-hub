## Android Development

Truck Hub attempts to make use of the latest Android libraries and best practices:
* Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (including [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)) with [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) for code style
* Makes use of [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/), including:
  * All appropriate [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/arch/), including **Lifecycles**, **LiveData**, **ViewModel**, **Room**, **Paging**, **Navigation** and **WorkManager**
  * [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout) 2.0, [ViewPager2](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/viewpager2/widget/ViewPager2) and more for layouts and UI
  * [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) for more fluent use of Android APIs
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)/[OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) for networking
* [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) for image loading
* [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) For UI Testing
* [Kodein](https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?6.5/android) for dependency injection
* Designed and built using Material Design [tools](https://material.io/tools/) and [components](https://material.io/develop/android/)
